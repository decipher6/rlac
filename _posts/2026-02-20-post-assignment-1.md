# Harry Potter: Fanfics and JK Rowling

The Harry Potter series didn't just make people want to read. It made them want to write. On sites like Archive of Our Own and FanFiction.net, fans have produced over 900,000 works set in Rowling's universe, some that closely follow canon and others that barely resemble it. This project looks at whether that gap between canon and fan fiction actually shows up in the language of the texts, using distant reading tools to find patterns that would be hard to notice otherwise.

## The Corpus

The corpus is made up of five texts. Two are the original novels, *Philosopher's Stone* (1997) and *Deathly Hallows* (2007), and three are fan fictions that each do something pretty different with the source material.

*Philosopher's Stone* is the beginning of everything — warm, funny, and full of food descriptions and wide-eyed wonder at a new world. *Deathly Hallows* is a completely different book in tone. It's dark, it's a war story, and most of the coziness from the early series is gone. Having both in the corpus is useful because it shows how Rowling's own language changed across a decade, which gives something meaningful to compare the fan fics against.

The three fan fictions cover very different ground. *Harry Potter Meets Harry Potter* by CaelynAilene is a post-war comedy where the characters discover that books, films, and fan fiction exist about them. It's self-aware and funny, and it gives Draco a much bigger role than Rowling ever did after the war ended. *And I Will Find You* by lyingleia is a Muggle AU, meaning no magic at all. Harry and Hermione are just two British students who meet at NYU. It's a slow romance and probably the most tonally distinct text in the whole corpus. *Harry Potter: Djinn Awakened* by Wishmaster1983 is the most complex one, a crossover with the *Wishmaster* films and the Netflix show *Lucifer*, where Lily Potter makes a wish from a Djinn to protect baby Harry, and it changes everything about who he grows up to be. It's dark, long, and reads more like original fantasy than fan fiction in places.

## What I Expected to Find

Before running any analysis, it helped to write down some specific expectations rather than just poking around the data hoping something interesting would show up. Three hypotheses felt worth focusing on.

The first is about food. *Philosopher's Stone* leans heavily on descriptions of feasts, meals, and food as a way of making Hogwarts feel real and inviting. The hypothesis is that this shows up measurably in word frequency, with food-related terms appearing far more in book one than in any of the other four texts, including *Deathly Hallows*, where survival has replaced comfort, and the fan fictions, where writers tend not to replicate that kind of worldbuilding texture.

The second is about character name distribution. In canon, Harry, Ron, and Hermione tend to get fairly balanced attention as a trio. But in the fan fictions, that balance should shift depending on the author's focus. lyingleia's fic is a Harry and Hermione romance, so those two names should appear at much closer rates than anywhere else in the corpus. CaelynAilene's fic, meanwhile, heavily features Draco in a way that canon never does post-war, so his name should spike noticeably compared to the novels.

The third is probably the most interesting one. *Djinn Awakened* is a fan fiction, but it's a dark, violence-heavy, mythology-dense story that shares a lot of thematic ground with *Deathly Hallows*. The hypothesis is that its vocabulary will sit closer to book seven than to book one, and that the two texts will show a measurable lexical similarity around words like death, dark, and war, up until the point where Wishmaster's own crossover terminology takes over and the two diverge.
